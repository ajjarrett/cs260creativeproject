          <p>
            Scientific literature is at the heart of good research.
            To be a successful researcher, you must know what is going on in
            your field of interest. This will help you to find gaps in knowledge
            and plan your own projects.
            When you finish research projects, you will write about your work
            and inform others in the field about the latest findings.
            In this way, scientists are helping other scientists to solve
            problems and move the field forward together.
              </p>

          <p>
          Many new researchers might feel intimidated by academic research
          articles because of the highly technical language. In fact,
          many researchers say that one of the hardest parts of joining a new
          research lab was understanding the language and literature of their
          new lab. Each discipline is almost a foreign language that must be
          learned.</p>

          <p>
            My undergraduate research mentor believed that the best onboarding
            task for new undergraduate students getting involved in research is
            to complete a literature review, which can be written and submitted
            for publication.

            This means going through anywhere between 50-200 research studies
            and trying to summarize the current state of the field on some
            topic.

            This type of a project really forces a student to immerse themselves
            in their field.
          </p>

          <p>
              I would recommend that as you begin reading scientific articles,
              read through them very slowly and thoroughly, trying to understand
              as much as you can. Have a highlighting tool ready to mark things and take notes as
              you read. For terms that are unfamiliar,
              look them up online and maybe watch a few YouTube videos to
              understand the concept at least on a surface-level.
              Then continue reading.
              After several dozen articles, you will begin to notice patterns
              about layout of scientific articles and themes in your chosen
              field of research.

           </p>

           <p>
                Research journals can be accessed through databases, if you are
                at an academic institution, they likely have a portal available
                to access the database that they pay for.
                Common databases include PubMed and others.
                Google Scholar is another nice tool that I like to use.
                If you find Open Access articles, then they are not hidden
                behind a pay wall and anyone can read them without paying anything.

          </p>

          <p>
                Enter a term in the box below and view the Google Scholar
                 search results.</p>
